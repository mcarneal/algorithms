 Write a function solution that, given an array A of N integers, returns the largest integer K > 0 such that both values K and −K (the opposite number) exist in array A. If there is no such integer, the function should return 0.
 1. Given A = [3, 2, −2, 5, −3], the function should return 3 (both 3 and −3 exist in array A).
 2. Given A = [1, 1, 2, −1, 2, −1], the function should return 1 (both 1 and −1 exist in array A).
 3. Given A = [1, 2, 3, −4], the function should return 0
